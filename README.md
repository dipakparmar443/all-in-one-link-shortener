## üìñ Description

**All In One Link Shortener** makes it easy to generate shortlinks for your WordPress content.  
You can choose from multiple providers such as **Bitly, TinyURL, Rebrandly**, or simply use your **own WordPress permalink**.

### üîë Compliance with WordPress.org Guidelines
- **External Services**: Only the permalink of your post/page is sent to third-party APIs (Bitly, TinyURL, Rebrandly). No personal data, titles, or analytics are transmitted.  
- **Privacy**: The plugin does **not** track users, collect analytics, or include hidden data collection. Shortlinks are only generated when publishing or updating a post.  

### ‚ú® Features
- Automatic shortlink generation on publish/update.  
- Providers: Bitly, TinyURL, Rebrandly, or native WordPress permalinks.  
- Copy-to-clipboard button in post editor and list tables.  
- Regenerate shortlinks via post actions or bulk actions.  
- WP-CLI support for developers.  
- Shortcode `[aiols_shortlink id="123"]`.  
- Secure API token setup in plugin settings.

## Security Best Practices
1. Treat tokens as secrets ‚Äî never commit them to Git or expose in public code.  
2. Store tokens only in plugin settings (WordPress Options) and never print them in frontend HTML.  
3. Limit token scope if the provider supports scopes/permissions.  
4. Rotate (revoke/regenerate) tokens periodically or immediately if compromised.  
5. Document in your plugin readme where tokens are stored and include links to each provider's privacy/terms pages.
