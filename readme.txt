Create shortlinks for WordPress posts/pages with Bitly, TinyURL, Rebrandly or permalinks.

== Description ==

**All In One Link Shortener** makes it easy to generate shortlinks for your WordPress content.  
You can choose from multiple providers such as **Bitly, TinyURL, Rebrandly**, or simply use your **own WordPress permalink**.

### ðŸ”‘ Compliance with WordPress.org Guidelines
- **Guideline 6 â€“ External Services**: This plugin connects to third-party APIs (Bitly, TinyURL, Rebrandly) to generate shortlinks. Only the permalink of your post/page is sent. Nothing else (title, user data, analytics) is transmitted. Each provider requires an API key/token that you generate yourself.  
- **Guidelines 7 & 9 â€“ No Tracking Without Consent**: This plugin does **not** track users, does not send analytics, and does not include hidden data collection. Shortlinks are generated only when you publish or update a post.  

### âœ¨ Features
- Automatic shortlink generation on publish/update.  
- Providers: Bitly, TinyURL, Rebrandly, or native WordPress permalinks.  
- Admin column with copy-to-clipboard button.  
- Regenerate shortlinks via post actions or bulk actions.  
- WP-CLI support for developers.  
- Shortcode `[aiols_shortlink id="123"]`.  
- API token setup in plugin settings.  

== How to generate API tokens ==

= Bitly (Generic Access Token) =
1. Sign in to your Bitly account at bitly.com.
2. Open Settings (left sidebar) and select the API / Developer section.
3. Find "Generic Access Token" (or OAuth / Access Tokens) and click Generate / Create.
4. You may be asked to re-enter your Bitly password â€” confirm to proceed.
5. Copy the token shown (store it securely; treat as a secret).
6. Paste the token into the plugin settings (Settings â†’ All In One Link Shortener) and save.
7. If needed, revoke/regenerate the token from the same Bitly settings page.

= TinyURL (API Key) =
1. Sign up or sign in at TinyURL (open the TinyURL developer/ dashboard page).
2. Go to the Developer / API or "API Settings" section in your TinyURL account.
3. Click "Create API Key" (or "Create token") and follow any prompts (name the key if asked).
4. Copy the generated API key and store it securely (do not publish it).
5. Paste the key into the plugin settings (Settings â†’ All In One Link Shortener) and save.
6. Use TinyURL's dashboard to revoke/regenerate the key if required.

= Rebrandly (API Key) =
1. Sign up or sign in at app.rebrandly.com (Rebrandly dashboard).
2. Open your account Dashboard â†’ Developer / API section.
3. Click "Create new API key" (or New API Key) and follow prompts.
4. Copy the generated API key and store it securely (do not commit it to VCS).
5. Paste the API key into the plugin settings (Settings â†’ All In One Link Shortener) and save.
6. Optionally, use OAuth instead of API key if you need delegated access; revoke/regenerate keys from the same dashboard.

= How to add the token to this plugin =
1. In WordPress admin go to Settings â†’ All In One Link Shortener.
2. Select your provider from the "Default Provider" dropdown.
3. Paste the provider token/API key into the "API Token" (or "API Key") field.
4. Click "Save Changes".
5. Verify: publish/update a post (or use a "Test" button if present) and confirm a shortlink is generated.

= Security & best practices =
1. Treat tokens as secrets â€” never commit them to Git or expose in public code.  
2. Store tokens only in plugin settings (WordPress Options) and never print them in frontend HTML.  
3. Limit token scope if the provider supports scopes/permissions.  
4. Rotate (revoke/regenerate) tokens periodically or immediately if compromised.  
5. Document in your plugin readme where tokens are stored and include links to each provider's privacy/terms pages.
